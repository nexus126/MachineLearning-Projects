Who is the happy Warrior ? Who is he That every man in arms should,William Wordsworth
"wish to be ? —It is the generous Spirit , who , when brought Among",William Wordsworth
"the tasks of real life , hath wrought Upon the plan that pleased his boyish",William Wordsworth
thought : Whose high endeavours are an inward light That makes the path before him,William Wordsworth
"always bright ; Who , with a natural instinct to discern What knowledge can perform",William Wordsworth
", is diligent to learn ; Abides by this resolve , and stops not there",William Wordsworth
", But makes his moral being his prime care ; Who , doomed to go",William Wordsworth
"in company with Pain , And Fear , and Bloodshed , miserable train ! Turns",William Wordsworth
his necessity to glorious gain ; In face of these doth exercise a power Which,William Wordsworth
"is our human nature 's highest dower : Controls them and subdues , transmutes ,",William Wordsworth
"bereaves Of their bad influence , and their good receives : By objects , which",William Wordsworth
"might force the soul to abate Her feeling , rendered more compassionate ; Is placable—because",William Wordsworth
"occasions rise So often that demand such sacrifice ; More skilful in self-knowledge , even",William Wordsworth
"more pure , As tempted more ; more able to endure , As more exposed",William Wordsworth
"to suffering and distress ; Thence , also , more alive to tenderness . —'Tis",William Wordsworth
he whose law is reason ; who depends Upon that law as on the best,William Wordsworth
"of friends ; Whence , in a state where men are tempted still To evil",William Wordsworth
"for a guard against worse ill , And what in quality or act is best",William Wordsworth
"Doth seldom on a right foundation rest , He labours good on good to fix",William Wordsworth
", and owes To virtue every triumph that he knows : —Who , if he",William Wordsworth
"rise to station of command , Rises by open means ; and there will stand",William Wordsworth
"On honourable terms , or else retire , And in himself possess his own desire",William Wordsworth
"; Who comprehends his trust , and to the same Keeps faithful with a singleness",William Wordsworth
"of aim ; And therefore does not stoop , nor lie in wait For wealth",William Wordsworth
", or honours , or for worldly state ; Whom they must follow ; on",William Wordsworth
"whose head must fall , Like showers of manna , if they come at all",William Wordsworth
": Whose powers shed round him in the common strife , Or mild concerns of",William Wordsworth
"ordinary life , A constant influence , a peculiar grace ; But who , if",William Wordsworth
he be called upon to face Some awful moment to which Heaven has joined Great,William Wordsworth
"issues , good or bad for human kind , Is happy as a Lover ;",William Wordsworth
"and attired With sudden brightness , like a Man inspired ; And , through the",William Wordsworth
"heat of conflict , keeps the law In calmness made , and sees what he",William Wordsworth
"foresaw ; Or if an unexpected call succeed , Come when it will , is",William Wordsworth
"equal to the need : —He who , though thus endued as with a sense",William Wordsworth
"And faculty for storm and turbulence , Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leans To",William Wordsworth
"homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes ; Sweet images ! which , wheresoe'er he be",William Wordsworth
", Are at his heart ; and such fidelity It is his darling passion to",William Wordsworth
"approve ; More brave for this , that he hath much to love : —",William Wordsworth
"'Tis , finally , the Man , who , lifted high , Conspicuous object in",William Wordsworth
"a Nation 's eye , Or left unthought-of in obscurity , — Who , with",William Wordsworth
"a toward or untoward lot , Prosperous or adverse , to his wish or not—",William Wordsworth
"Plays , in the many games of life , that one Where what he most",William Wordsworth
"doth value must be won : Whom neither shape or danger can dismay , Nor",William Wordsworth
"thought of tender happiness betray ; Who , not content that former worth stand fast",William Wordsworth
", Looks forward , persevering to the last , From well to better , daily",William Wordsworth
"self-surpast : Who , whether praise of him must walk the earth For ever ,",William Wordsworth
"and to noble deeds give birth , Or he must fall , to sleep without",William Wordsworth
"his fame , And leave a dead unprofitable name— Finds comfort in himself and in",William Wordsworth
"his cause ; And , while the mortal mist is gathering , draws His breath",William Wordsworth
in confidence of Heaven 's applause : This is the happy Warrior ; this is,William Wordsworth
he That every man in arms should wish to be . There is a change—and,William Wordsworth
"I am poor ; Your love hath been , nor long ago , A fountain",William Wordsworth
"at my fond heart 's door , Whose only business was to flow ; And",William Wordsworth
"flow it did ; not taking heed Of its own bounty , or my need",William Wordsworth
. What happy moments did I count ! Blest was I then all bliss above,William Wordsworth
"! Now , for that consecrated fount Of murmuring , sparkling , living love ,",William Wordsworth
What have I ? shall I dare to tell ? A comfortless and hidden well,William Wordsworth
". A well of love—it may be deep— I trust it is , —and never",William Wordsworth
dry : What matter ? if the waters sleep In silence and obscurity . —Such,William Wordsworth
"change , and at the very door Of my fond heart , hath made me",William Wordsworth
poor . Earth has not anything to show more fair : Dull would he be,William Wordsworth
of soul who could pass by A sight so touching in its majesty : This,William Wordsworth
"City now doth , like a garment , wear The beauty of the morning ;",William Wordsworth
"silent , bare , Ships , towers , domes , theatres , and temples lie",William Wordsworth
"Open unto the fields , and to the sky ; All bright and glittering in",William Wordsworth
"the smokeless air . Never did sun more beautifully steep In his first splendour ,",William Wordsworth
"valley , rock , or hill ; Ne'er saw I , never felt , a",William Wordsworth
calm so deep ! The river glideth at his own sweet will : Dear God,William Wordsworth
! the very houses seem asleep ; And all that mighty heart is lying still,William Wordsworth
"! I was thy neighbour once , thou rugged Pile ! Four summer weeks I",William Wordsworth
dwelt in sight of thee : I saw thee every day ; and all the,William Wordsworth
"while Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea . So pure the sky ,",William Wordsworth
"so quiet was the air ! So like , so very like , was day",William Wordsworth
"to day ! Whene'er I looked , thy Image still was there ; It trembled",William Wordsworth
", but it never passed away . How perfect was the calm ! it seemed",William Wordsworth
"no sleep ; No mood , which season takes away , or brings : I",William Wordsworth
could have fancied that the mighty Deep Was even the gentlest of all gentle things,William Wordsworth
". Ah ! then , if mine had been the Painter 's hand , To",William Wordsworth
"express what then I saw ; and add the gleam , The light that never",William Wordsworth
"was , on sea or land , The consecration , and the Poet 's dream",William Wordsworth
"; I would have planted thee , thou hoary Pile Amid a world how different",William Wordsworth
from this ! Beside a sea that could not cease to smile ; On tranquil,William Wordsworth
"land , beneath a sky of bliss . Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine",William Wordsworth
Of peaceful years ; a chronicle of heaven ; — Of all the sunbeams that,William Wordsworth
did ever shine The very sweetest had to thee been given . A Picture had,William Wordsworth
"it been of lasting ease , Elysian quiet , without toil or strife ; No",William Wordsworth
"motion but the moving tide , a breeze , Or merely silent Nature 's breathing",William Wordsworth
"life . Such , in the fond illusion of my heart , Such Picture would",William Wordsworth
I at that time have made : And seen the soul of truth in every,William Wordsworth
"part , A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed . So once it would",William Wordsworth
"have been , —'tis so no more ; I have submitted to a new control",William Wordsworth
": A power is gone , which nothing can restore ; A deep distress hath",William Wordsworth
humanised my Soul . Not for a moment could I now behold A smiling sea,William Wordsworth
", and be what I have been : The feeling of my loss will ne'er",William Wordsworth
"be old ; This , which I know , I speak with mind serene .",William Wordsworth
"Then , Beaumont , Friend ! who would have been the Friend , If he",William Wordsworth
"had lived , of Him whom I deplore , This work of thine I blame",William Wordsworth
"not , but commend ; This sea in anger , and that dismal shore .",William Wordsworth
"O 't is a passionate Work ! —yet wise and well , Well chosen is",William Wordsworth
"the spirit that is here ; That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell ,",William Wordsworth
"This rueful sky , this pageantry of fear ! And this huge Castle , standing",William Wordsworth
"here sublime , I love to see the look with which it braves , Cased",William Wordsworth
"in the unfeeling armour of old time , The lightning , the fierce wind ,",William Wordsworth
"the trampling waves . Farewell , farewell the heart that lives alone , Housed in",William Wordsworth
"a dream , at distance from the Kind ! Such happiness , wherever it be",William Wordsworth
"known , Is to be pitied ; for 't is surely blind . But welcome",William Wordsworth
"fortitude , and patient cheer , And frequent sights of what is to be borne",William Wordsworth
"! Such sights , or worse , as are before me here.— Not without hope",William Wordsworth
"we suffer and we mourn . When first , descending from the moorlands , I",William Wordsworth
"saw the Stream of Yarrow glide Along a bare and open valley , The Ettrick",William Wordsworth
"Shepherd was my guide . When last along its banks I wandered , Through groves",William Wordsworth
"that had begun to shed Their golden leaves upon the pathways , My steps the",William Wordsworth
"Border-minstrel led . The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer , 'Mid mouldering ruins low he",William Wordsworth
"lies ; And death upon the braes of Yarrow , Has closed the Shepherd-poet 's",William Wordsworth
"eyes : Nor has the rolling year twice measured , From sign to sign ,",William Wordsworth
"its stedfast course , Since every mortal power of Coleridge Was frozen at its marvellous",William Wordsworth
"source ; The rapt One , of the godlike forehead , The heaven-eyed creature sleeps",William Wordsworth
"in earth : And Lamb , the frolic and the gentle , Has vanished from",William Wordsworth
"his lonely hearth . Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits , Or waves that own",William Wordsworth
"no curbing hand , How fast has brother followed brother , From sunshine to the",William Wordsworth
"sunless land ! Yet I , whose lids from infant slumber Were earlier raised ,",William Wordsworth
"remain to hear A timid voice , that asks in whispers , '' Who next",William Wordsworth
"will drop and disappear ? '' Our haughty life is crowned with darkness , Like",William Wordsworth
"London with its own black wreath , On which with thee , O Crabbe !",William Wordsworth
"forth-looking , I gazed from Hampstead 's breezy heath . As if but yesterday departed",William Wordsworth
", Thou too art gone before ; but why , O'er ripe fruit , seasonably",William Wordsworth
"gathered , Should frail survivors heave a sigh ? Mourn rather for that holy Spirit",William Wordsworth
", Sweet as the spring , as ocean deep ; For Her who , ere",William Wordsworth
"her summer faded , Has sunk into a breathless sleep . No more of old",William Wordsworth
"romantic sorrows , For slaughtered Youth or love-lorn Maid ! With sharper grief is Yarrow",William Wordsworth
"smitten , And Ettrick mourns with her their Poet dead . Oh ! pleasant exercise",William Wordsworth
of hope and joy ! For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood Upon our,William Wordsworth
"side , we who were strong in love ! Bliss was it in that dawn",William Wordsworth
"to be alive , But to be young was very heaven ! —Oh ! times",William Wordsworth
", In which the meagre , stale , forbidding ways Of custom , law ,",William Wordsworth
"and statute , took at once The attraction of a country in romance ! When",William Wordsworth
"Reason seemed the most to assert her rights , When most intent on making of",William Wordsworth
herself A prime Enchantress—to assist the work Which then was going forward in her name,William Wordsworth
"! Not favoured spots alone , but the whole earth , The beauty wore of",William Wordsworth
"promise , that which sets ( As at some moment might not be unfelt Among",William Wordsworth
the bowers of paradise itself ) The budding rose above the rose full blown .,William Wordsworth
What temper at the prospect did not wake To happiness unthought of ? The inert,William Wordsworth
"Were roused , and lively natures rapt away ! They who had fed their childhood",William Wordsworth
"upon dreams , The playfellows of fancy , who had made All powers of swiftness",William Wordsworth
", subtilty , and strength Their ministers , —who in lordly wise had stirred Among",William Wordsworth
"the grandest objects of the sense , And dealt with whatsoever they found there As",William Wordsworth
"if they had within some lurking right To wield it ; —they , too ,",William Wordsworth
"who , of gentle mood , Had watched all gentle motions , and to these",William Wordsworth
"Had fitted their own thoughts , schemers more wild , And in the region of",William Wordsworth
"their peaceful selves ; — Now was it that both found , the meek and",William Wordsworth
"lofty Did both find , helpers to their heart 's desire , And stuff at",William Wordsworth
"hand , plastic as they could wish ; Were called upon to exercise their skill",William Wordsworth
", Not in Utopia , subterranean fields , Or some secreted island , Heaven knows",William Wordsworth
"where ! But in the very world , which is the world Of all of",William Wordsworth
"us , —the place where in the end We find our happiness , or not",William Wordsworth
at all ! Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed Their snow-white blossoms on my head,William Wordsworth
", With brightest sunshine round me spread Of spring 's unclouded weather , In this",William Wordsworth
sequestered nook how sweet To sit upon my orchard-seat ! And birds and flowers once,William Wordsworth
"more to greet , My last year 's friends together . One have I marked",William Wordsworth
", the happiest guest In all this covert of the blest : Hail to Thee",William Wordsworth
", far above the rest In joy of voice and pinion ! Thou , Linnet",William Wordsworth
"! in thy green array , Presiding Spirit here to-day , Dost lead the revels",William Wordsworth
"of the May ; And this is thy dominion . While birds , and butterflies",William Wordsworth
", and flowers , Make all one band of paramours , Thou , ranging up",William Wordsworth
"and down the bowers , Art sole in thy employment : A Life , a",William Wordsworth
"Presence like the Air , Scattering thy gladness without care , Too blest with any",William Wordsworth
one to pair ; Thyself thy own enjoyment . Amid yon tuft of hazel trees,William Wordsworth
", That twinkle to the gusty breeze , Behold him perched in ecstasies , Yet",William Wordsworth
seeming still to hover ; There ! where the flutter of his wings Upon his,William Wordsworth
"back and body flings Shadows and sunny glimmerings , That cover him all over .",William Wordsworth
"My dazzled sight he oft deceives , A brother of the dancing leaves ; Then",William Wordsworth
"flits , and from the cottage-eaves Pours forth his song in gushes ; As if",William Wordsworth
by that exulting strain He mocked and treated with disdain The voiceless Form he chose,William Wordsworth
"to feign , While fluttering in the bushes . I travelled among unknown men ,",William Wordsworth
"In lands beyond the sea ; Nor , England ! did I know till then",William Wordsworth
"What love I bore to thee . 'T is past , that melancholy dream !",William Wordsworth
Nor will I quit thy shore A second time ; for still I seem To,William Wordsworth
love thee more and more . Among thy mountains did I feel The joy of,William Wordsworth
my desire ; And she I cherished turned her wheel Beside an English fire .,William Wordsworth
"Thy mornings showed , thy nights concealed , The bowers where Lucy played ; And",William Wordsworth
thine too is the last green field That Lucy 's eyes surveyed . I wandered,William Wordsworth
"lonely as a cloud That floats on high o'er vales and hills , When all",William Wordsworth
"at once I saw a crowd , A host , of golden daffodils ; Beside",William Wordsworth
"the lake , beneath the trees , Fluttering and dancing in the breeze . Continuous",William Wordsworth
"as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milky way , They stretched in",William Wordsworth
never-ending line Along the margin of a bay : Ten thousand saw I at a,William Wordsworth
"glance , Tossing their heads in sprightly dance . The waves beside them danced ;",William Wordsworth
but they Out-did the sparkling waves in glee : A poet could not but be,William Wordsworth
"gay , In such a jocund company : I gazed—and gazed—but little thought What wealth",William Wordsworth
"the show to me had brought : For oft , when on my couch I",William Wordsworth
"lie In vacant or in pensive mood , They flash upon that inward eye Which",William Wordsworth
"is the bliss of solitude ; And then my heart with pleasure fills , And",William Wordsworth
"dances with the daffodils . Wisdom and Spirit of the universe ! Thou Soul ,",William Wordsworth
that art the Eternity of thought ! And giv'st to forms and images a breath,William Wordsworth
"And everlasting motion ! not in vain , By day or star-light , thus from",William Wordsworth
my first dawn Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me The passions that build up,William Wordsworth
our human soul ; Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man ; But,William Wordsworth
"with high objects , with enduring things , With life and nature ; purifying thus",William Wordsworth
"The elements of feeling and of thought , And sanctifying by such discipline Both pain",William Wordsworth
"and fear , —until we recognise A grandeur in the beatings of the heart .",William Wordsworth
"Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me With stinted kindness . In November days ,",William Wordsworth
When vapours rolling down the valleys made A lonely scene more lonesome ; among woods,William Wordsworth
"At noon ; and 'mid the calm of summer nights , When , by the",William Wordsworth
"margin of the trembling lake , Beneath the gloomy hills , homeward I went In",William Wordsworth
"solitude , such intercourse was mine : Mine was it in the fields both day",William Wordsworth
"and night , And by the waters , all the summer long . And in",William Wordsworth
"the frosty season , when the sun Was set , and , visible for many",William Wordsworth
"a mile , The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed , I heeded not the summons",William Wordsworth
: happy time It was indeed for all of us ; for me It was,William Wordsworth
"a time of rapture ! Clear and loud The village-clock tolled six—I wheeled about ,",William Wordsworth
Proud and exulting like an untired horse That cares not for his home.—All shod with,William Wordsworth
"steel We hissed along the polished ice , in games Confederate , imitative of the",William Wordsworth
"chase And woodland pleasures , —the resounding horn , The pack loud-chiming , and the",William Wordsworth
"hunted hare . So through the darkness and the cold we flew , And not",William Wordsworth
"a voice was idle ; with the din Smitten , the precipices rang aloud ;",William Wordsworth
The leafless trees and every icy crag Tinkled like iron ; while far-distant hills Into,William Wordsworth
"the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy , not unnoticed while the stars ,",William Wordsworth
"Eastward , were sparkling clear , and in the west The orange sky of evening",William Wordsworth
"died away . Not seldom from the uproar I retired Into a silent bay ,",William Wordsworth
"or sportively Glanced sideway , leaving the tumultuous throng , To cut across the reflex",William Wordsworth
"of a star ; Image , that , flying still before me , gleamed Upon",William Wordsworth
"the glassy plain : and oftentimes , When we had given our bodies to the",William Wordsworth
"wind , And all the shadowy banks on either side Came sweeping through the darkness",William Wordsworth
", spinning still The rapid line of motion , then at once Have I ,",William Wordsworth
"reclining back upon my heels , Stopped short ; yet still the solitary cliffs Wheeled",William Wordsworth
by me—even as if the earth had rolled With visible motion her diurnal round !,William Wordsworth
"Behind me did they stretch in solemn train , Feebler and feebler , and I",William Wordsworth
stood and watched Till all was tranquil as a summer sea . Tax not the,William Wordsworth
"royal Saint with vain expense , With ill-matched aims the Architect who planned— Albeit labouring",William Wordsworth
for a scanty band Of white-robed Scholars only—this immense And glorious Work of fine intelligence,William Wordsworth
! Give all thou canst ; high Heaven rejects the lore Of nicely-calculated less or,William Wordsworth
"more ; So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense These lofty pillars ,",William Wordsworth
"spread that branching roof Self-poised , and scooped into ten thousand cells , Where light",William Wordsworth
"and shade repose , where music dwells Lingering—and wandering on as loth to die ;",William Wordsworth
Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof That they were born for immortality . It,William Wordsworth
"is a beauteous evening , calm and free , The holy time is quiet as",William Wordsworth
a Nun Breathless with adoration ; the broad sun Is sinking down in its tranquility,William Wordsworth
; The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea ; Listen ! the mighty Being,William Wordsworth
"is awake , And doth with his eternal motion make A sound like thunder—everlastingly .",William Wordsworth
"Dear child ! dear Girl ! that walkest with me here , If thou appear",William Wordsworth
"untouched by solemn thought , Thy nature is not therefore less divine : Thou liest",William Wordsworth
in Abraham 's bosom all the year ; And worshipp'st at the Temple 's inner,William Wordsworth

"with pomp of waters , unwithstood , '' Roused though it be full often to",William Wordsworth
"a mood Which spurns the check of salutary bands , That this most famous Stream",William Wordsworth
in bogs and sands Should perish ; and to evil and to good Be lost,William Wordsworth
for ever . In our halls is hung Armoury of the invincible Knights of old,William Wordsworth
": We must be free or die , who speak the tongue That Shakespeare spake",William Wordsworth
; the faith and morals hold Which Milton held.—In every thing we are sprung Of,William Wordsworth
"Earth 's first blood , have titles manifold . `` With sacrifice before the rising",William Wordsworth
morn Vows have I made by fruitless hope inspired ; And from the infernal Gods,William Wordsworth
", 'mid shades forlorn Of night , my slaughtered Lord have I required : Celestial",William Wordsworth
"pity I again implore ; — Restore him to my sight—great Jove , restore !",William Wordsworth
"'' So speaking , and by fervent love endowed With faith , the Suppliant heavenward",William Wordsworth
"lifts her hands ; While , like the sun emerging from a cloud , Her",William Wordsworth
"countenance brightens—and her eye expands ; Her bosom heaves and spreads , her stature grows",William Wordsworth
; As she expects the issue in repose . O terror ! what hath she,William Wordsworth
perceived ? —O joy ! What doth she look on ? —whom doth she behold,William Wordsworth
? Her Hero slain upon the beach of Troy ? His vital presence ? his,William Wordsworth
corporeal mould ? It is—if sense deceive her not—'tis He ! And a God leads,William Wordsworth
"him , wingèd Mercury ! Mild Hermes spake—and touched her with his wand That calms",William Wordsworth
"all fear ; `` Such grace hath crowned thy prayer , Laodamía ! that at",William Wordsworth
Jove 's command Thy husband walks the paths of upper air : He comes to,William Wordsworth
"tarry with thee three hours ' space ; Accept the gift , behold him face",William Wordsworth
to face ! '' Forth sprang the impassioned Queen her Lord to clasp ; Again,William Wordsworth
that consummation she essayed ; But unsubstantial Form eludes her grasp As often as that,William Wordsworth
"eager grasp was made . The Phantom parts—but parts to re-unite , And re-assume his",William Wordsworth
"place before her sight . `` Protesiláus , lo ! thy guide is gone !",William Wordsworth
"Confirm , I pray , the vision with thy voice : This is our palace",William Wordsworth

"blest a sad abode . '' `` Great Jove , Laodamía ! doth not leave",William Wordsworth

"my worth obtain ; For fearless virtue bringeth boundless gain . `` Thou knowest ,",William Wordsworth
the Delphic oracle foretold That the first Greek who touched the Trojan strand Should die,William Wordsworth

; The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters ; And all the air is,William Wordsworth
filled with pleasant noise of waters . All things that love the sun are out,William Wordsworth

his voice to me was like a stream Scarce heard ; nor word from word,William Wordsworth
could I divide ; And the whole body of the Man did seem Like one,William Wordsworth
whom I had met with in a dream ; Or like a man from some,William Wordsworth

in that I honour most . Great princes ' favourites their fair,William Shakespeare

"With all-triumphant splendour on my brow ; But out , alack !",William Shakespeare
he was but one hour mine ; The region cloud hath mask,William Shakespeare

"the cloud thou break , To dry the rain on my storm-beaten",William Shakespeare
"face , For no man well of such a salve can speak",William Shakespeare
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace : Nor can,William Shakespeare
"thy shame give physic to my grief ; Though thou repent ,",William Shakespeare
yet I have still the loss : The offender ’ s sorrow,William Shakespeare
lends but weak relief To him that bears the strong offence ’,William Shakespeare
s cross . Ah ! but those tears are pearl which thy,William Shakespeare
"love sheds , And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds",William Shakespeare

them all : What hast thou then more than thou hadst before,William Shakespeare

"if for my love thou my love receivest , I can not",William Shakespeare
blame thee for my love thou usest ; But yet be blamed,William Shakespeare
if thou this self deceivest By wilful taste of what thyself refusest,William Shakespeare
". I do forgive thy robb ’ ry , gentle thief ,",William Shakespeare
Although thou steal thee all my poverty ; And yet love knows,William Shakespeare
it is a greater grief To bear love ’ s wrong than,William Shakespeare
"hate ’ s known injury . Lascivious grace , in whom all",William Shakespeare

"powerful rhyme , But you shall shine more bright in these contents",William Shakespeare
Than unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time . When wasteful war shall,William Shakespeare

Nor Mars his sword nor war ’ s quick fire shall burn,William Shakespeare
The living record of your memory . ’ Gainst death and all-oblivious,William Shakespeare

I have seen by Time 's fell hand defac'd The rich proud,William Shakespeare

"such interchange of state , Or state itself confounded to decay ;",William Shakespeare
"Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate , That Time will come",William Shakespeare
and take my love away . This thought is as a death,William Shakespeare
", which can not choose But weep to have that which it",William Shakespeare

"all these , from these would I be gone , Save that",William Shakespeare
", to die , I leave my love alone . No longer",William Shakespeare

surly sullen bell Give warning to the world that I am fled,William Shakespeare
"From this vile world with vilest worms to dwell ; Nay ,",William Shakespeare
"if you read this line , remember not The hand that writ",William Shakespeare
"it ; for I love you so , That I in your",William Shakespeare
"sweet thoughts would be forgot , If thinking on me then should",William Shakespeare
"make you woe . O , if ( I say ) you",William Shakespeare
"look upon this verse , When I ( perhaps ) compounded am",William Shakespeare
"with clay , Do not so much as my poor name rehearse",William Shakespeare
", But let your love even with my life decay , Lest",William Shakespeare
"the wise world should look into your moan , And mock you",William Shakespeare
with me after I am gone . That time of year thou,William Shakespeare
"mayst in me behold When yellow leaves , or none , or",William Shakespeare
"few , do hang Upon those boughs which shake against the cold",William Shakespeare
", Bare ruin 'd choirs , where late the sweet birds sang",William Shakespeare
. In me thou see'st the twilight of such day As after,William Shakespeare
"sunset fadeth in the west , Which by and by black night",William Shakespeare
"doth take away , Death 's second self , that seals up",William Shakespeare
all in rest . In me thou see'st the glowing of such,William Shakespeare
"fire That on the ashes of his youth doth lie , As",William Shakespeare
"the death-bed whereon it must expire , Consum 'd with that which",William Shakespeare
"it was nourish 'd by . This thou perceiv'st , which makes",William Shakespeare
"thy love more strong , To love that well which thou must",William Shakespeare
leave ere long . Why is my verse so barren of new,William Shakespeare
"pride , So far from variation or quick change ? Why with",William Shakespeare
"the time do I not glance aside To new-found methods , and",William Shakespeare
"to compounds strange ? Why write I still all one , ever",William Shakespeare
"the same , And keep invention in a noted weed , That",William Shakespeare
"every word doth almost tell my name , Showing their birth ,",William Shakespeare
"and where they did proceed ? O know , sweet love ,",William Shakespeare
"I always write of you , And you and love are still",William Shakespeare
"my argument , So all my best is dressing old words new",William Shakespeare
", Spending again what is already spent : For as the sun",William Shakespeare
"is daily new and old , So is my love still telling",William Shakespeare
what is told . Farewell ! thou art too dear for my,William Shakespeare
"possessing , And like enough thou knowst thy estimate . The Charter",William Shakespeare
of thy worth gives thee releasing ; My bonds in thee are,William Shakespeare
all determinate . For how do I hold thee but by thy,William Shakespeare
"granting , And for that riches where is my deserving ? The",William Shakespeare
"cause of this fair gift in me is wanting , And so",William Shakespeare
"my patent back again is swerving . Thy self thou gav'st ,",William Shakespeare
"thy own worth then not knowing , Or me , to whom",William Shakespeare
"thou gav'st it , else mistaking , So thy great gift ,",William Shakespeare
"upon misprision growing , Comes home again , on better judgement making",William Shakespeare
. Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter :,William Shakespeare
"In sleep a king , but waking no such matter . They",William Shakespeare
"that have power to hurt and will do none , That do",William Shakespeare
"not do the thing they most do show , Who , moving",William Shakespeare
"others , are themselves as stone , Unmoved , cold , and",William Shakespeare
to temptation slow : They rightly do inherit heaven 's graces And,William Shakespeare
husband nature 's riches from expense ; They are the lords and,William Shakespeare
"owners of their faces , Others but stewards of their excellence .",William Shakespeare
The summer 's flower is to the summer sweet Though to itself,William Shakespeare
"it only live and die , But if that flower with base",William Shakespeare
"infection meet , The basest weed outbraves his dignity : For sweetest",William Shakespeare
things turn sourest by their deeds ; Lilies that fester smell far,William Shakespeare
worse than weeds . How like a winter hath my absence been,William Shakespeare
"From thee , the pleasure of the fleeting year ! What freezings",William Shakespeare
"have I felt , what dark days seen ! What old December",William Shakespeare
's bareness everywhere ! And yet this time remov 'd was summer,William Shakespeare
"'s time , The teeming autumn , big with rich increase ,",William Shakespeare
"Bearing the wanton burthen of the prime , Like widow 'd wombs",William Shakespeare
after their lords ' decease : Yet this abundant issue seem 'd,William Shakespeare
to me But hope of orphans and unfather 'd fruit ; For,William Shakespeare
"summer and his pleasures wait on thee , And thou away ,",William Shakespeare
"the very birds are mute ; Or if they sing , 't",William Shakespeare
"is with so dull a cheer That leaves look pale , dreading",William Shakespeare
the winter 's near . From you have I been absent in,William Shakespeare
"the spring , When proud-pied April , dressed in all his trim",William Shakespeare
", Hath put a spirit of youth in everything , That heavy",William Shakespeare
Saturn laughed and leaped with him . Yet nor the lays of,William Shakespeare
"birds , nor the sweet smell Of different flowers in odour and",William Shakespeare
"in hue , Could make me any summer ’ s story tell",William Shakespeare
", Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew :",William Shakespeare
"Nor did I wonder at the lily ’ s white , Nor",William Shakespeare
praise the deep vermilion in the rose ; They were but sweet,William Shakespeare
", but figures of delight Drawn after you , – you pattern",William Shakespeare
"of all those . Yet seem ’ d it winter still ,",William Shakespeare
"and , you away , As with your shadow I with these",William Shakespeare
"did play . To me , fair friend , you never can",William Shakespeare
"be old , For as you were when first your eye I",William Shakespeare
"eyed , Such seems your beauty still . Three winters cold Have",William Shakespeare
"from the forests shook three summers ’ pride , Three beauteous springs",William Shakespeare
to yellow autumn turned In process of the seasons have I seen,William Shakespeare
", Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burned , Since first",William Shakespeare
"I saw you fresh , which yet are green . Ah ,",William Shakespeare
"yet doth beauty , like a dial-hand , Steal from his figure",William Shakespeare
", and no pace perceived ; So your sweet hue , which",William Shakespeare
"methinks still doth stand , Hath motion , and mine eye may",William Shakespeare
"be deceived : For fear of which , hear this , thou",William Shakespeare
age unbred : Ere you were born was beauty ’ s summer,William Shakespeare
dead . When in the chronicle of wasted time I see descriptions,William Shakespeare
"of the fairest wights , And beauty making beautiful old rhyme In",William Shakespeare
"praise of ladies dead and lovely knights , Then , in the",William Shakespeare
"blazon of sweet beauty 's best , Of hand , of foot",William Shakespeare
", of lip , of eye , of brow , I see",William Shakespeare
their antique pen would have express'd Even such a beauty as you,William Shakespeare
master now . So all their praises are but prophecies Of this,William Shakespeare
"our time , all you prefiguring ; And , for they look",William Shakespeare
"'d but with divining eyes , They had not skill enough your",William Shakespeare
"worth to sing : For we , which now behold these present",William Shakespeare
"days , Have eyes to wonder , but lack tongues to praise",William Shakespeare
". Not mine own fears , nor the prophetic soul Of the",William Shakespeare
"wide world dreaming on things to come , Can yet the lease",William Shakespeare
"of my true love control , Suppos 'd as forfeit to a",William Shakespeare
confin 'd doom . The mortal moon hath her eclipse endur'd And,William Shakespeare
the sad augurs mock their own presage ; Incertainties now crown themselves,William Shakespeare
assur'd And peace proclaims olives of endless age . Now with the,William Shakespeare
"drops of this most balmy time My love looks fresh , and",William Shakespeare
"Death to me subscribes , Since , spite of him , I",William Shakespeare
"'ll live in this poor rhyme , While he insults o'er dull",William Shakespeare
and speechless tribes ; And thou in this shalt find thy monument,William Shakespeare
", When tyrants ' crests and tombs of brass are spent .",William Shakespeare
"O ! never say that I was false of heart , Though",William Shakespeare
absence seemed my flame to qualify . As easy might I from,William Shakespeare
"myself depart As from my soul , which in thy breast doth",William Shakespeare
lie : That is my home of love ; if I have,William Shakespeare
"ranged , Like him that travels , I return again , Just",William Shakespeare
"to the time , not with the time exchanged , So that",William Shakespeare
"myself bring water for my stain . Never believe , though in",William Shakespeare
"my nature reigned All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood ,",William Shakespeare
"That it could so preposterously be stained , To leave for nothing",William Shakespeare
all thy sum of good ; For nothing this wide universe I,William Shakespeare
"call , Save thou , my rose ; in it thou art",William Shakespeare
"my all . Alas , 't is true I have gone here",William Shakespeare
"and there And made myself a motley to the view , Gor",William Shakespeare
"'d mine own thoughts , sold cheap what is most dear ,",William Shakespeare
Made old offences of affections new . Most true it is that,William Shakespeare
"I have look 'd on truth Askance and strangely : but ,",William Shakespeare
"by all above , These blenches gave my heart another youth ,",William Shakespeare
And worse essays prov 'd thee my best of love . Now,William Shakespeare
"all is done , have what shall have no end ! Mine",William Shakespeare
"appetite , I never more will grind On newer proof , to",William Shakespeare
"try an older friend , A god in love , to whom",William Shakespeare
"I am confin 'd . Then give me welcome , next my",William Shakespeare
"heaven the best , Even to thy pure and most most loving",William Shakespeare
"breast . O , for my sake do you with Fortune chide",William Shakespeare
", The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds , That did not",William Shakespeare

ye Even that your pity is enough to cure me . Let,William Shakespeare

Caesar hath wept : Ambition should be made of sterner stuff :,William Shakespeare
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious ; And Brutus is an honourable,William Shakespeare

And all the clouds that lour 'd upon our house In the,William Shakespeare
deep bosom of the ocean buried . Now are our brows bound,William Shakespeare
with victorious wreaths ; Our bruised arms hung up for monuments ;,William Shakespeare

"Well then , what answer ? '' He that while she spake , Mindful of what he brought","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

". '' Then , ere that last weird battle in the west , There came on Arthur sleeping","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", Gawain kill'd In Lancelot 's war , the ghost of Gawain blown Along a wandering wind ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"and past his ear Went shrilling , `` Hollow , hollow all delight ! Hail , King !","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

"I am blown along a wandering wind , And hollow , hollow , hollow all delight . ''","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"And fainter onward , like wild birds that change Their season in the night and wail their way","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"From cloud to cloud , down the long wind the dream Shrill 'd ; but in going mingled","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"with dim cries Far in the moonlit haze among the hills , As of some lonely city sack","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"'d by night , When all is lost , and wife and child with wail Pass to new","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

"This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake : '' O me , my King , let pass","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

", and knights Once thine , whom thou hast loved , but grosser grown Than heathen , spitting","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
at their vows and thee . Right well in heart they know thee for the King . Arise,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", go forth and conquer as of old . '' Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere :","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"'' Far other is this battle in the west Whereto we move , than when we strove in","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"youth , And brake the petty kings , and fought with Rome , Or thrust the heathen from","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the Roman wall , And shook him thro ' the north . Ill doom is mine To war","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
against my people and my knights . The king who fights his people fights himself . And they,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"my knights , who loved me once , the stroke That strikes them dead is as my death","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"to me . Yet let us hence , and find or feel a way Thro ' this blind","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"haze , which ever since I saw One lying in the dust at Almesbury , Hath folded in","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the passes of the world . '' Then rose the King and moved his host by night ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"And ever push 'd Sir Modred , league by league , Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse—","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"A land of old upheaven from the abyss By fire , to sink into the abyss again ;","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt , And the long mountains ended in a coast Of ever-shifting sand","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", and far away The phantom circle of a moaning sea . There the pursuer could pursue no","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"more , And he that fled no further fly the King ; And there , that day when","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the great light of heaven Burn 'd at his lowest in the rolling year , On the waste","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
sand by the waste sea they closed . Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight Like this,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"last , dim , weird battle of the west . A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
": Whereof the chill , to him who breathed it , drew Down with his blood , till","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"all his heart was cold With formless fear ; and ev'n on Arthur fell Confusion , since he","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"saw not whom he fought . For friend and foe were shadows in the mist , And friend","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"slew friend not knowing whom he slew ; And some had visions out of golden youth , And","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
some beheld the faces of old ghosts Look in upon the battle ; and in the mist Was,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"many a noble deed , many a base , And chance and craft and strength in single fights","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", And ever and anon with host to host Shocks , and the splintering spear , the hard","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"mail hewn , Shield-breakings , and the clash of brands , the crash Of battleaxes on shatter 'd","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"helms , and shrieks After the Christ , of those who falling down Look 'd up for heaven","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", and only saw the mist ; And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights , Oaths ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"insult , filth , and monstrous blasphemies , Sweat , writhings , anguish , labouring of the lungs","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"In that close mist , and cryings for the light , Moans of the dying , and voices","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"of the dead . Last , as by some one deathbed after wail Of suffering , silence follows","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", or thro ' death Or deathlike swoon , thus over all that shore , Save for some","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"whisper of the seething seas , A dead hush fell ; but when the dolorous day Grew drearier","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"toward twilight falling , came A bitter wind , clear from the North , and blew The mist","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"aside , and with that wind the tide Rose , and the pale King glanced across the field","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Of battle : but no man was moving there ; Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Nor yet of heathen ; only the wan wave Brake in among dead faces , to and fro","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Swaying the helpless hands , and up and down Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen , And","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"shiver 'd brands that once had fought with Rome , And rolling far along the gloomy shores The","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"voice of days of old and days to be . Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
And whiter than the mist that all day long Had held the field of battle was the King,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
": '' Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world , And wastes the narrow realm whereon","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"we move , And beats upon the faces of the dead , My dead , as tho '","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"they had not died for me ? — O Bedivere , for on my heart hath fall'n Confusion","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", till I know not what I am , Nor whence I am , nor whether I be","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"King . Behold , I seem but King among the dead . '' Then spake the bold Sir","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Bedivere : `` My King , King everywhere ! and so the dead have kings , There also","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"will I worship thee as King . Yet still thy life is whole , and still I live","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Who love thee ; but who hates thee , he that brought The heathen back among us ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"yonder stands , Modred , unharm 'd , the traitor of thine house . '' Then spake the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
King : `` My house hath been my doom . But call not thou this traitor of my,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
house Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me . My house are rather they who sware,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"my vows , Yea , even while they brake them , own 'd me King . And well","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"for thee , saying in my dark hour , When all the purport of my throne hath fail","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"'d , That quick or dead thou hottest me for King . King am I , whatsoever be","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"their cry ; And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see Yet , ere I pass .","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
'' And uttering this the King Made at the man : then Modred smote his liege Hard on,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"that helm which many a heathen sword Had beaten thin ; while Arthur at one blow , Striking","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the last stroke with Excalibur , Slew him , and all but slain himself , he fell .","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
So all day long the noise of battle roll'd Among the mountains by the winter sea ; Until,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"King Arthur 's Table , man by man , Had fall'n in Lyonnesse about their lord , King","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Arthur . Then , because his wound was deep , The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him , And","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"bore him to a chapel nigh the field , A broken chancel with a broken cross , That","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"stood on a dark strait of barren land : On one side lay the Ocean , and on","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"one Lay a great water , and the moon was full . Then spake King Arthur to Sir","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
Bedivere : '' The sequel of to-day unsolders all The goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
holds record . Such a sleep They sleep—the men I loved . I think that we Shall never,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"more , at any future time , Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds , Walking about","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the gardens and the halls Of Camelot , as in the days that were . I perish by","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"this people which I made , — Tho ' Merlin sware that I should come again To rule","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"once more ; but , let what will be , be , I am so deeply smitten thro","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
' the helm That without help I can not last till morn . Thou therefore take my brand,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Excalibur , Which was my pride : for thou rememberest how In those old days , one summer","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"noon , an arm Rose up from out the bosom of the lake , Clothed in white samite","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", mystic , wonderful , Holding the sword—and how I row 'd across And took it , and","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"have worn it , like a king ; And , wheresoever I am sung or told In aftertime","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", this also shall be known : But now delay not : take Excalibur , And fling him","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"far into the middle mere : Watch what thou seëst , and lightly bring me word . ''","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere : '' It is not meet , Sir King , to","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"leave thee thus , Aidless , alone , and smitten thro ' the helm— A little thing may","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"harm a wounded man ; Yet I thy hest will all perform at full , Watch what I","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"see , and lightly bring thee word . '' So saying , from the ruin 'd shrine he","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"stept , And in the moon athwart the place of tombs , Where lay the mighty bones of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"ancient men , Old knights , and over them the sea-wind sang Shrill , chill , with flakes","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"of foam . He , stepping down By zigzag paths , and juts of pointed rock , Came","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"on the shining levels of the lake . There drew he forth the brand Excalibur , And o'er","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"him , drawing it , the winter moon , Brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
forth And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt : For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", Myriads of topaz-lights , and jacinth-work Of subtlest jewellery . He gazed so long That both his","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"eyes were dazzled as he stood , This way and that dividing the swift mind , In act","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
to throw : but at the last it seem'd Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd There in the many-knotted,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"waterflags , That whistled stiff and dry about the marge . So strode he back slow to the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
wounded King . Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere : '' Hast thou perform 'd my mission,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
which I gave ? What is it thou hast seen ? or what hast heard ? '' And,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"answer made the bold Sir Bedivere : '' I heard the ripple washing in the reeds , And","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the wild water lapping on the crag . '' To whom replied King Arthur , faint and pale","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
": '' Thou hast betray 'd thy nature and thy name , Not rendering true answer , as","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"beseem'd Thy fealty , nor like a noble knight : For surer sign had follow 'd , either","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"hand Or voice , or else a motion of the mere . This is a shameful thing for","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"men to lie . Yet now , I charge thee , quickly go again , As thou art","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"lief and dear , and do the thing I bade thee , watch , and lightly bring me","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"word . '' Then went Sir Bedivere the second time Across the ridge , and paced beside the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"mere , Counting the dewy pebbles , fix 'd in thought ; But when he saw the wonder","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"of the hilt , How curiously and strangely chased , he smote His palms together , and he","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"cried aloud : '' And if indeed I cast the brand away , Surely a precious thing ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"one worthy note , Should thus be lost for ever from the earth , Which might have pleased","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the eyes of many men . What good should follow this , if this were done ? What","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"harm , undone ? Deep harm to disobey , Seeing obedience is the bond of rule . Were","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"it well to obey then , if a king demand An act unprofitable , against himself ? The","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"King is sick , and knows not what he does . What record , or what relic of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"my lord Should be to aftertime , but empty breath And rumours of a doubt ? But were","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"this kept , Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings , Some one might show it at a","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"joust of arms , Saying , 'King Arthur 's sword , Excalibur , Wrought by the lonely maiden","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"of the Lake . Nine years she wrought it , sitting in the deeps Upon the hidden bases","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
of the hills . ' So might some old man speak in the aftertime To all the people,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", winning reverence . But now much honour and much fame were lost . '' So spake he","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", clouded with his own conceit , And hid Excalibur the second time , And so strode back","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"slow to the wounded King . Then spoke King Arthur , breathing heavily : '' What is it","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
thou hast seen ? or what hast heard ? ' And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere :,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"'' I heard the water lapping on the crag , And the long ripple washing in the reeds","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". '' To whom replied King Arthur , much in wrath : '' Ah , miserable and unkind","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", untrue , Unknightly , traitor-hearted ! Woe is me ! Authority forgets a dying king , Laid","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
widow 'd of the power in his eye That bow 'd the will . I see thee what,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"thou art , For thou , the latest-left of all my knights , In whom should meet the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"offices of all , Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt ; Either from lust of gold","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", or like a girl Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes . Yet , for a man","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"may fail in duty twice , And the third time may prosper , get thee hence : But","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", if thou spare to fling Excalibur , I will arise and slay thee with my hands .","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"'' Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere , and ran , And , leaping down the ridges , lightly","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", plunged Among the bulrush beds , and clutch 'd the sword , And strongly wheel 'd and","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"threw it . The great brand Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon , And flashing round","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"and round , and whirl 'd in an arch , Shot like a streamer of the northern morn","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", Seen where the moving isles of winter shock By night , with noises of the Northern Sea","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". So flash 'd and fell the brand Excalibur : But ere he dipt the surface , rose","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"an arm Clothed in white samite , mystic wonderful , And caught him by the hilt , and","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"brandish 'd him Three times , and drew him under in the mere . And lightly went the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"other to the King . Then spoke King Arthur , drawing thicker breath : '' Now see I","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"by thine eyes that this is done . Speak out : what is it thou hast heard ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"or seen ? '' And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere : '' Sir King , I closed","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"mine eyelids , lest the gems Should blind my purpose , for I never saw , Nor shall","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"see , here or elsewhere , till I die , Not tho ' I live three lives of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"mortal men , So great a miracle as yonder hilt . Then with both hands I flung him","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", wheeling him ; But when I look 'd again , behold an arm , Clothed in white","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"samite , mystic , wonderful , That caught him by the hilt , and brandish 'd him Three","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"times , and drew him under in the mere . '' And answer made King Arthur , breathing","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
hard : '' My end draws nigh ; 't is time that I were gone . Make broad,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"thy shoulders to receive my weight , And bear me to the margin ; yet I fear My","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"wound hath taken cold , and I shall die . '' So saying , from the pavement he","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"half rose , Slowly , with pain , reclining on his arm , And looking wistfully with wide","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"blue eyes As in a picture . Him Sir Bedivere Remorsefully regarded thro ' his tears , And","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"would have spoken , but he found not words ; Then took with care , and kneeling on","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"one knee , O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands , And rising bore him thro '","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the place of tombs . But , as he walk 'd , King Arthur panted hard , Like","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
one that feels a nightmare on his bed When all the house is mute . So sigh 'd,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the King , Muttering and murmuring at his ear , `` Quick , quick ! I fear it","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"is too late , and I shall die . '' But the other swiftly strode from ridge to","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"ridge , Clothed with his breath , and looking , as he walk 'd , Larger than human","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"on the frozen hills . He heard the deep behind him , and a cry Before . His","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
own thought drove him like a goad . Dry clash 'd his harness in the icy caves And,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"barren chasms , and all to left and right The bare black cliff clang 'd round him ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
as he based His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"heels— And on a sudden , lo ! the level lake , And the long glories of the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"winter moon . Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge , Dark as a funeral scarf","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"from stem to stern , Beneath them ; and descending they were ware That all the decks were","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"dense with stately forms , Black-stoled , black-hooded , like a dream—by these Three Queens with crowns of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"gold : and from them rose A cry that shiver 'd to the tingling stars , And ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"as it were one voice , an agony Of lamentation , like a wind that shrills All night","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"in a waste land , where no one comes , Or hath come , since the making of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the world . Then murmur 'd Arthur , `` Place me in the barge . '' So to","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the barge they came . There those three Queens Put forth their hands , and took the King","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", and wept . But she , that rose the tallest of them all And fairest , laid","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"his head upon her lap , And loosed the shatter 'd casque , and chafed his hands ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"And call 'd him by his name , complaining loud , And dropping bitter tears against a brow","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Striped with dark blood : for all his face was white And colourless , and like the wither","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
'd moon Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east ; And all his greaves and cuisses,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
dash 'd with drops Of onset ; and the light and lustrous curls— That made his forehead like,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"a rising sun High from the daïs-throne—were parch 'd with dust Or , clotted into points and hanging","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"loose , Mix 'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips . So like a shatter 'd","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"column lay the King ; Not like that Arthur who , with lance in rest , From spur","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"to plume a star of tournament , Shot thro ' the lists at Camelot , and charged Before","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
the eyes of ladies and of kings . Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere : '' Ah,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"! my Lord Arthur , whither shall I go ? Where shall I hide my forehead and my","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"eyes ? For now I see the true old times are dead , When every morning brought a","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"noble chance , And every chance brought out a noble knight . Such times have been not since","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
the light that led The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh . But now the whole Round,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Table is dissolved Which was an image of the mighty world , And I , the last ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"go forth companionless , And the days darken round me , and the years , Among new men","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", strange faces , other minds . '' And slowly answer 'd Arthur from the barge : ''","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"The old order changeth , yielding place to new , And God fulfils himself in many ways ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world . Comfort thyself : what comfort is in me ?,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"I have lived my life , and that which I have done May He within himself make pure","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"! but thou , If thou shouldst never see my face again , Pray for my soul .","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of . Wherefore , let thy voice Rise","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
like a fountain for me night and day . For what are men better than sheep or goats,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"That nourish a blind life within the brain , If , knowing God , they lift not hands","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
of prayer Both for themselves and those who call them friend ? For so the whole round earth,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
is every way Bound by gold chains about the feet of God . But now farewell . I,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
am going a long way With these thou seëst—if indeed I go ( For all my mind is,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"clouded with a doubt ) — To the island-valley of Avilion ; Where falls not hail , or","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"rain , or any snow , Nor ever wind blows loudly ; but it lies Deep-meadow 'd ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"happy , fair with orchard lawns And bowery hollows crown 'd with summer sea , Where I will","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"heal me of my grievous wound . '' So said he , and the barge with oar and","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"sail Moved from the brink , like some full-breasted swan That , fluting a wild carol ere her","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"death , Ruffles her pure cold plume , and takes the flood With swarthy webs . Long stood","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Sir Bedivere Revolving many memories , till the hull Look 'd one black dot against the verge of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"dawn , And on the mere the wailing died away . But when that moan had past for","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"evermore , The stillness of the dead world 's winter dawn Amazed him , and he groan 'd","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", The King is gone . '' And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme , '' From","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
the great deep to the great deep he goes . '' Whereat he slowly turn 'd and slowly,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
clomb The last hard footstep of that iron crag ; Thence mark 'd the black hull moving yet,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", and cried , '' He passes to be King among the dead , And after healing of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"his grievous wound He comes again ; but—if he come no more— O me , be yon dark","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

Bedivere : '' The sequel of to-day unsolders all The goodliest fellowship of famous knights Whereof this world,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
holds record . Such a sleep They sleep—the men I loved . I think that we Shall never,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

"this people which I made , — Tho ' Merlin sware that I should come again To rule","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"once more—but let what will be , be , I am so deeply smitten thro ' the helm","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"That without help I can not last till morn . Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur , Which","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"was my pride : for thou rememberest how In those old days , one summer noon , an","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"arm Rose up from out the bosom of the lake , Clothed in white samite , mystic ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"wonderful , Holding the sword—and how I row 'd across And took it , and have worn it","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", like a king : And , wheresoever I am sung or told In aftertime , this also","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"shall be known : But now delay not : take Excalibur , And fling him far into the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"middle mere : Watch what thou seëst , and lightly bring me word . '' To him replied","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the bold Sir Bedivere : '' It is not meet , Sir King , to leave thee thus","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", Aidless , alone , and smitten thro ' the helm . A little thing may harm a","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"wounded man . Yet I thy hest will all perform at full , Watch what I see ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"and lightly bring thee word . '' So saying , from the ruin 'd shrine he stept And","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"in the moon athwart the place of tombs , Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Old knights , and over them the sea-wind sang Shrill , chill , with flakes of foam .","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"He , stepping down By zigzag paths , and juts of pointed rock , Came on the shining","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"levels of the lake . There drew he forth the brand Excalibur , And o'er him , drawing","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"it , the winter moon , Brightening the skirts of a long cloud , ran forth And sparkled","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"keen with frost against the hilt : For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks , Myriads of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"topaz-lights , and jacinth work Of subtlest jewellery . He gazed so long That both his eyes were","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"dazzled , as he stood , This way and that dividing the swift mind , In act to","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
throw : but at the last it seem'd Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd There in the many-knotted water-flags,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", That whistled stiff and dry about the marge . So strode he back slow to the wounded","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
King . Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere : '' Hast thou perform 'd my mission which,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"I gave ? What is it thou hast seen , or what hast heard ? '' And answer","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"made the bold Sir Bedivere : '' I heard the ripple washing in the reeds , And the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"wild water lapping on the crag . '' To whom replied King Arthur , faint and pale :","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"'' Thou hast betray 'd thy nature and thy name , Not rendering true answer , as beseem'd","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Thy fealty , nor like a noble knight : For surer sign had follow 'd , either hand","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", Or voice , or else a motion of the mere . This is a shameful thing for","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

"and dear , and do the thing I bade thee , watch , and lightly bring me word","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". '' Then went Sir Bedivere the second time Across the ridge , and paced beside the mere","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", Counting the dewy pebbles , fixed in thought ; But when he saw the wonder of the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"hilt , How curiously and strangely chased , he smote His palms together , and he cried aloud","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", '' And if indeed I cast the brand away , Surely a precious thing , one worthy","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"note , Should thus be lost forever from the earth , Which might have pleased the eyes of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"many men . What good should follow this , if this were done ? What harm , undone","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"? deep harm to disobey , Seeing obedience is the bond of rule . Were it well to","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

", and knows not what he does . What record , or what relic of my lord Should","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

", Saying , 'King Arthur 's sword , Excalibur , Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"; Nine years she wrought it , sitting in the deeps Upon the hidden bases of the hills","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". ' So might some old man speak in the aftertime To all the people , winning reverence","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". But now much honour and much fame were lost . '' So spake he , clouded with","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"his own conceit , And hid Excalibur the second time , And so strode back slow to the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"wounded King . Then spoke King Arthur , breathing heavily : '' What is it thou hast seen","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", or what hast heard ? '' And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere : '' I heard","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the water lapping on the crag , And the long ripple washing in the reeds . '' To","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"whom replied King Arthur , much in wrath : '' Ah , miserable and unkind , untrue ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Unknightly , traitor-hearted ! Woe is me ! Authority forgets a dying king , Laid widow 'd of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the power in his eye That bow 'd the will . I see thee what thou art ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"For thou , the latest-left of all my knights , In whom should meet the offices of all","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt ; Either from lust of gold , or like","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"a girl Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes . Yet , for a man may fail in","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"duty twice , And the third time may prosper , get thee hence : But , if thou","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"spare to fling Excalibur , I will arise and slay thee with my hands . '' Then quickly","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"rose Sir Bedivere , and ran , And , leaping down the ridges lightly , plunged Among the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"bulrush-beds , and clutch 'd the sword , And strongly wheel 'd and threw it . The great","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"brand Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon , And flashing round and round , and whirl","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"'d in an arch , Shot like a streamer of the northern morn , Seen where the moving","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"isles of winter shock By night , with noises of the northern sea . So flash 'd and","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"fell the brand Excalibur : But ere he dipt the surface , rose an arm Clothed in white","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"samite , mystic , wonderful , And caught him by the hilt , and brandish 'd him Three","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"times , and drew him under in the mere . And lightly went the other to the King","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". Then spoke King Arthur , drawing thicker breath : '' Now see I by thine eyes that","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"this is done . Speak out : what is it thou hast heard , or seen ? ''","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere : '' Sir King , I closed mine eyelids , lest","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the gems Should blind my purpose , for I never saw , Nor shall see , here or","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"elsewhere , till I die , Not tho ' I live three lives of mortal men , So","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"great a miracle as yonder hilt . Then with both hands I flung him , wheeling him ;","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"But when I look 'd again , behold an arm , Clothed in white samite , mystic ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"wonderful , That caught him by the hilt , and brandish 'd him Three times , and drew","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"him under in the mere . '' And answer made King Arthur , breathing hard : '' My","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
end draws nigh ; 't is time that I were gone . Make broad thy shoulders to receive,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"my weight , And bear me to the margin ; yet I fear My wound hath taken cold","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", and I shall die . '' So saying , from the pavement he half rose , Slowly","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
", with pain , reclining on his arm , And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes As in","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"a picture . Him Sir Bedivere Remorsefully regarded thro ' his tears , And would have spoken ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"but he found not words , Then took with care , and kneeling on one knee , O'er","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"both his shoulders drew the languid hands , And rising bore him thro ' the place of tombs","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". But , as he walk 'd , King Arthur panted hard , Like one that feels a","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
nightmare on his bed When all the house is mute . So sigh 'd the King Muttering and,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"murmuring at his ear , `` Quick , quick ! I fear it is too late , and","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"I shall die . '' But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge , Clothed with his","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"breath , and looking , as he walk'd Larger than human on the frozen hills . He heard","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the deep behind him , and a cry Before . His own thought drove him like a goad","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". Dry clash 'd his harness in the icy caves And barren chasms , and all to left","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"and right The bare black cliff clang 'd round him , as he based His feet on juts","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"of slippery crag that rang Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels— And on a sudden , lo","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"! the level lake , And the long glories of the winter moon . Then saw they how","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"there hove a dusky barge Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern , Beneath them ;","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"and descending they were ware That all the decks were dense with stately forms Black-stoled , black-hooded ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
like a dream—by these Three Queens with crowns of gold—and from them rose A cry that shiver 'd,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"to the tingling stars , And , as it were one voice , an agony Of lamentation ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"like a wind , that shrills All night in a waste land , where no one comes ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Or hath come , since the making of the world . Then murmur 'd Arthur , `` Place","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"me in the barge , '' And to the barge they came . There those three Queens Put","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"forth their hands , and took the King , and wept . But she that rose the tallest","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"of them all And fairest , laid his head upon her lap , And loosed the shatter 'd","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"casque , and chafed his hands , And call 'd him by his name , complaining loud And","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
dropping bitter tears against his brow Striped with dark blood : for all his face was white And,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"colourless , and like the wither 'd moon Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east ;","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
And all his greaves and cuisses dash 'd with drops Of onset ; and the light and lustrous,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
curls— That made his forehead like a rising sun High from the daïs-throne—were parch 'd with dust ;,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"Or , clotted into points and hanging loose , Mix 'd with the knightly growth that fringed his","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"lips . So like a shatter 'd column lay the King ; Not like that Arthur who ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"with lance in rest , From spur to plume a star of tournament , Shot thro ' the","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"lists at Camelot , and charged Before the eyes of ladies and of kings . Then loudly cried","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"the bold Sir Bedivere : '' Ah ! my Lord Arthur , whither shall I go ? Where","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
shall I hide my forehead and my eyes ? For now I see the true old times are,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"dead , When every morning brought a noble chance , And every chance brought out a noble knight","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
. Such times have been not since the light that led The holy Elders with the gift of,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
myrrh . But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved Which was an image of the mighty world,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"; And I , the last , go forth companionless , And the days darken round me ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"and the years , Among new men , strange faces , other minds . '' And slowly answer","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"'d Arthur from the barge : '' The old order changeth , yielding place to new , And","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"God fulfils Himself in many ways , Lest one good custom should corrupt the world . Comfort thyself","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
": what comfort is in me ? I have lived my life , and that which I have","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"done May He within Himself make pure ! but thou , If thou shouldst never see my face","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"again , Pray for my soul . More things are wrought by prayer Than this world dreams of","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
". Wherefore , let thy voice Rise like a fountain for me night and day . For what","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"are men better than sheep or goats That nourish a blind life within the brain , If ,","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"knowing God , they lift not hands of prayer Both for themselves and those who call them friend","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
? For so the whole round earth is every way Bound by gold chains about the feet of,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
God . But now farewell . I am going a long way With these thou seëst—if indeed I,"Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

"Where falls not hail , or rain , or any snow , Nor ever wind blows loudly ;","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"
"but it lies Deep-meadow 'd , happy , fair with orchard-lawns And bowery hollows crown 'd with summer","Alfred, Lord Tennyson"

"our songs , O friend , Will make death clear or make life durable . Howbeit with",Algernon Charles Swinburne
rose and ivy and wild vine And with wild notes about this dust of thine At least,Algernon Charles Swinburne
I fill the place where white dreams dwell And wreathe an unseen shrine . XVII Sleep ;,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"and if life was bitter to thee , pardon , If sweet , give thanks ; thou",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"hast no more to live ; And to give thanks is good , and to forgive .",Algernon Charles Swinburne
Out of the mystic and the mournful garden Where all day through thine hands in barren braid,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Wove the sick flowers of secrecy and shade , Green buds of sorrow and sin , and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"remnants grey , Sweet-smelling , pale with poison , sanguine-hearted , Passions that sprang from sleep and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"thoughts that started , Shall death not bring us all as thee one day Among the days",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"departed ? XVIII For thee , O now a silent soul , my brother , Take at",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"my hands this garland , and farewell . Thin is the leaf , and chill the wintry",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"smell , And chill the solemn earth , a fatal mother , With sadder than the Niobean",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"womb , And in the hollow of her breasts a tomb . Content thee , howsoe'er ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"whose days are done ; There lies not any troublous thing before , Nor sight nor sound",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"to war against thee more , For whom all winds are quiet as the sun , All",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"waters as the shore . Kneel down , fair Love , and fill thyself with tears ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Girdle thyself with sighing for a girth Upon the sides of mirth , Cover thy lips and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"eyelids , let thine ears Be filled with rumour of people sorrowing ; Make thee soft raiment",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"out of woven sighs Upon the flesh to cleave , Set pains therein and many a grievous",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"thing , And many sorrows after each his wise For armlet and for gorget and for sleeve",Algernon Charles Swinburne
". O Love 's lute heard about the lands of death , Left hanged upon the trees",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"that were therein ; O Love and Time and Sin , Three singing mouths that mourn now",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"underbreath , Three lovers , each one evil spoken of ; O smitten lips wherethrough this voice",Algernon Charles Swinburne
of mine Came softer with her praise ; Abide a little for our lady 's love .,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"The kisses of her mouth were more than wine , And more than peace the passage of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"her days . O Love , thou knowest if she were good to see . O Time",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", thou shalt not find in any land Till , cast out of thine hand , The",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sunlight and the moonlight fail from thee , Another woman fashioned like as this . O Sin",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", thou knowest that all thy shame in her Was made a goodly thing ; Yea ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"she caught Shame and shamed him with her kiss , With her fair kiss , and lips",Algernon Charles Swinburne
much lovelier Than lips of amorous roses in late spring . By night there stood over against,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"my bed Queen Venus with a hood striped gold and black , Both sides drawn fully back",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"From brows wherein the sad blood failed of red , And temples drained of purple and full",Algernon Charles Swinburne
of death . Her curled hair had the wave of sea-water And the sea 's gold in,Algernon Charles Swinburne
it . Her eyes were as a dove 's that sickeneth . Strewn dust of gold she,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"had shed over her , And pearl and purple and amber on her feet . Upon her",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"raiment of dyed sendaline Were painted all the secret ways of love And covered things thereof ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
That hold delight as grape-flowers hold their wine ; Red mouths of maidens and red feet of,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"doves , And brides that kept within the bride-chamber Their garment of soft shame , And weeping",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"faces of the wearied loves That swoon in sleep and awake wearier , With heat of lips",Algernon Charles Swinburne
and hair shed out like flame . The tears that through her eyelids fell on me Made,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"mine own bitter where they ran between As blood had fallen therein , She saying ; Arise",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", lift up thine eyes and see If any glad thing be or any good Now the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
best thing is taken forth of us ; Even she to whom all praise Was as one,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"flower in a great multitude , One glorious flower of many and glorious , One day found",Algernon Charles Swinburne
gracious among many days : Even she whose handmaiden was Love—to whom At kissing times across her,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"stateliest bed Kings bowed themselves and shed Pale wine , and honey with the honeycomb , And",Algernon Charles Swinburne
spikenard bruised for a burnt-offering ; Even she between whose lips the kiss became As fire and,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"frankincense ; Whose hair was as gold raiment on a king , Whose eyes were as the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"morning purged with flame , Whose eyelids as sweet savour issuing thence . Then I beheld ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
and lo on the other side My lady 's likeness crowned and robed and dead . Sweet,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"still , but now not red , Was the shut mouth whereby men lived and died .",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"And sweet , but emptied of the blood 's blue shade , The great curled eyelids that",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"withheld her eyes . And sweet , but like spoilt gold , The weight of colour in",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"her tresses weighed . And sweet , but as a vesture with new dyes , The body",Algernon Charles Swinburne
that was clothed with love of old . Ah ! that my tears filled all her woven,Algernon Charles Swinburne
hair And all the hollow bosom of her gown— Ah ! that my tears ran down Even,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"to the place where many kisses were , Even where her parted breast-flowers have place , Even",Algernon Charles Swinburne
where they are cloven apart—who knows not this ? Ah ! the flowers cleave apart And their,Algernon Charles Swinburne
sweet fills the tender interspace ; Ah ! the leaves grown thereof were things to kiss Ere,Algernon Charles Swinburne
their fine gold was tarnished at the heart . Ah ! in the days when God did,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"good to me , Each part about her was a righteous thing ; Her mouth an almsgiving",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", The glory of her garments charity , The beauty of her bosom a good deed ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"In the good days when God kept sight of us ; Love lay upon her eyes ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
And on that hair whereof the world takes heed ; And all her body was more virtuous,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Than souls of women fashioned otherwise . Now , ballad , gather poppies in thine hands And",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sheaves of brier and many rusted sheaves Rain-rotten in rank lands , Waste marigold and late unhappy",Algernon Charles Swinburne
leaves And grass that fades ere any of it be mown ; And when thy bosom is,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"filled full thereof Seek out Death 's face ere the light altereth , And say `` My",Algernon Charles Swinburne
master that was thrall to Love Is become thrall to Death . '' Bow down before him,Algernon Charles Swinburne
", ballad , sigh and groan . But make no sojourn in thy outgoing ; For haply",Algernon Charles Swinburne
it may be That when thy feet return at evening Death shall come in with thee .,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Bird of the bitter bright grey golden morn Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
First of us all and sweetest singer born Whose far shrill note the world of new men,Algernon Charles Swinburne
hears Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears ; When song new-born put off the old,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"world 's attire And felt its tune on her changed lips expire , Writ foremost on the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"roll of them that came Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre , Villon , our",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sad bad glad mad brother 's name ! Alas the joy , the sorrow , and the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"scorn , That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears , And gave thee stones",Algernon Charles Swinburne
for bread and tares for corn And plume-plucked gaol-birds for thy starveling peers Till death clipt close,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"their flight with shameful shears ; Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire Could buy thee bread or kisses ; when,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"light fame Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar , Villon , our sad",Algernon Charles Swinburne
bad glad mad brother 's name ! Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn !,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears ! Poor perfect voice , most blithe",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"when most forlorn , That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers Like joy-bells crossed with",Algernon Charles Swinburne
death-bells in our ears ! What far delight has cooled the fierce desire That like some ravenous,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"bird was strong to tire On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame , But left",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"more sweet than roses to respire , Villon , our sad bad glad mad brother 's name",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"? Prince of sweet songs made out of tears and fire , A harlot was thy nurse",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", a God thy sire ; Shame soiled thy song , and song assoiled thy shame .",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"But from thy feet now death has washed the mire , Love reads out first at head",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"of all our quire , Villon , our sad bad glad mad brother 's name . A",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"month or twain to live on honeycomb Is pleasant ; but one tires of scented time ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Cold sweet recurrence of accepted rhyme , And that strong purple under juice and foam Where the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
wine ’ s heart has burst ; Nor feel the latter kisses like the first . Once,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"yet , this poor one time ; I will not pray Even to change the bitterness of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"it , The bitter taste ensuing on the sweet , To make your tears fall where your",Algernon Charles Swinburne
soft hair lay All blurred and heavy in some perfumed wise Over my face and eyes .,Algernon Charles Swinburne
And yet who knows what end the scythèd wheat Makes of its foolish poppies ’ mouths of,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"red ? These were not sown , these are not harvested , They grow a month and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"are cast under feet And none has care thereof , As none has care of divided love",Algernon Charles Swinburne
". I know each shadow of your lips by rote , Each change of love in eyelids",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"and eyebrows ; The fashion of fair temples tremulous With tender blood , and colour of your",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"throat ; I know not how love is gone out of this , Seeing that all was",Algernon Charles Swinburne
his . Love ’ s likeness there endures upon all these : But out of these one,Algernon Charles Swinburne
shall not gather love . Day hath not strength nor the night shade enough To make love,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"whole and fill his lips with ease , As some bee-builded cell Feels at filled lips the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
heavy honey swell . I know not how this last month leaves your hair Less full of,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"purple colour and hid spice , And that luxurious trouble of closed eyes Is mixed with meaner",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"shadows and waste care ; And love , kissed out by pleasure , seems not yet Worth",Algernon Charles Swinburne
patience to regret . There was a graven image of Desire Painted with red blood on a,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"ground of gold Passing between the young men and the old , And by him Pain ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"whose body shone like fire , And Pleasure with gaunt hands that grasped their hire . Of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"his left wrist , with fingers clenched and cold , The insatiable Satiety kept hold , Walking",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"with feet unshod that pashed the mire . The senses and the sorrows and the sins ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
And the strange loves that suck the breasts of Hate Till lips and teeth bite in their,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sharp indenture , Followed like beasts with flap of wings and fins . Death stood aloof behind",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"a gaping grate , Upon whose lock was written Peradventure . Forth from Calais , at dawn",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"of night , when sunset summer on autumn shone , Fared the steamer alert and loud through",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"seas whence only the sun was gone : Soft and sweet as the sky they smiled ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"and bade man welcome : a dim sweet hour Gleamed and whispered in wind and sea ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"and heaven was fair as a field in flower , Stars fulfilled the desire of the darkling",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"world as with music : the star-bright air Made the face of the sea , if aught",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"may make the face of the sea , more fair . Whence came change ? Was the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sweet night weary of rest ? What anguish awoke in the dark ? Sudden , sublime ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
the strong storm spake : we heard the thunders as hounds that bark . Lovelier if aught,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"may be lovelier than stars , we saw the lightnings exalt the sky , Living and lustrous",Algernon Charles Swinburne
and rapturous as love that is born but to quicken and lighten and die . Heaven 's,Algernon Charles Swinburne
own heart at its highest of delight found utterance in music and semblance in fire : Thunder,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"on thunder exulted , rejoicing to live and to satiate the night 's desire . And the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
night was alive and anhungered of life as a tiger from toils cast free : And a,Algernon Charles Swinburne
rapture of rage made joyous the spirit and strength of the soul of the sea . All,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"the weight of the wind bore down on it , freighted with death for fraught : And",Algernon Charles Swinburne
the keen waves kindled and quickened as things transfigured or things distraught . And madness fell on,Algernon Charles Swinburne
them laughing and leaping ; and madness came on the wind : And the might and the,Algernon Charles Swinburne
light and the darkness of storm were as storm in the heart of Ind . Such glory,Algernon Charles Swinburne
", such terror , such passion , as lighten and harrow the far fierce East , Rang",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", shone , spake , shuddered around us : the night was an altar with death for",Algernon Charles Swinburne
priest . The channel that sunders England from shores where never was man born free Was clothed,Algernon Charles Swinburne
with the likeness and thrilled with the strength and the wrath of a tropic sea . As,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"a wild steed ramps in rebellion , and rears till it swerves from a backward fall ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"The strong ship struggled and reared , and her deck was upright as a sheer cliff 's",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"wall . Stern and prow plunged under , alternate : a glimpse , a recoil , a",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"breath , And she sprang as the life in a god made man would spring at the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"throat of death . Three glad hours , and it seemed not an hour of supreme and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"supernal joy , Filled full with delight that revives in remembrance a sea-bird 's heart in a",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"boy . For the central crest of the night was cloud that thundered and flamed , sublime",Algernon Charles Swinburne
As the splendour and song of the soul everlasting that quickens the pulse of time . The,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"glory beholden of man in a vision , the music of light overheard , The rapture and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"radiance of battle , the life that abides in the fire of a word , In the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"midmost heaven enkindled , was manifest far on the face of the sea , And the rage",Algernon Charles Swinburne
in the roar of the voice of the waters was heard but when heaven breathed free .,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Far eastward , clear of the covering of cloud , the sky laughed out into light From",Algernon Charles Swinburne
the rims of the storm to the sea 's dark edge with flames that were flowerlike and,Algernon Charles Swinburne
white . The leaping and luminous blossoms of live sheet lightning that laugh as they fade From,Algernon Charles Swinburne
the cloud 's black base to the black wave 's brim rejoiced in the light they made,Algernon Charles Swinburne
". Far westward , throned in a silent sky , where life was in lustrous tune ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Shone , sweeter and surer than morning or evening , the steadfast smile of the moon .",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"The limitless heaven that enshrined them was lovelier than dreams may behold , and deep As life",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"or as death , revealed and transfigured , may shine on the soul through sleep . All",Algernon Charles Swinburne
glories of toil and of triumph and passion and pride that it yearns to know Bore witness,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"there to the soul of its likeness and kinship , above and below . The joys of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"the lightnings , the songs of the thunders , the strong sea 's labour and rage ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
Were tokens and signs of the war that is life and is joy for the soul to,Algernon Charles Swinburne
wage . No thought strikes deeper or higher than the heights and the depths that the night,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"made bare , Illimitable , infinite , awful and joyful , alive in the summit of air—",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Air stilled and thrilled by the tempest that thundered between its reign and the sea 's ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Rebellious , rapturous , and transient as faith or as terror that bows men 's knees .",Algernon Charles Swinburne
No love sees loftier and fairer the form of its godlike vision in dreams Than the world,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"shone then , when the sky and the sea were as love for a breath 's length",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"seems— One utterly , mingled and mastering and mastered and laughing with love that subsides As the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"glad mad night sank panting and satiate with storm , and released the tides . In the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"dense mid channel the steam-souled ship hung hovering , assailed and withheld As a soul born royal",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", if life or if death be against it , is thwarted and quelled . As the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
glories of myriads of glowworms in lustrous grass on a boundless lawn Were the glories of flames,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"phosphoric that made of the water a light like dawn . A thousand Phosphors , a thousand",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Hespers , awoke in the churning sea , And the swift soft hiss of them living and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
dying was clear as a tune could be ; As a tune that is played by the,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"fingers of death on the keys of life or of sleep , Audible alway alive in the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"storm , too fleet for a dream to keep : Too fleet , too sweet for a",Algernon Charles Swinburne

as the passing of sleep is the passing of tempest seemed When the light and the sound,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"of it sank , and the glory was gone as a dream half dreamed . The glory",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", the terror , the passion that made of the midnight a miracle , died , Not",Algernon Charles Swinburne

"God that were wearied of power upon heaven , and were fain of a new God 's",Algernon Charles Swinburne

". The waters , heaving and hungering at heart , made way , and were wellnigh fain",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", For the ship that had fought them , and wrestled , and revelled in labour ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
to cease from her pain . And an end was made of it : only remembrance endures,Algernon Charles Swinburne
of the glad loud strife ; And the sense that a rapture so royal may come not,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"again in the passage of life . Love , what ailed thee to leave life that was",Algernon Charles Swinburne

"Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers , Or where the wind 's feet shine",Algernon Charles Swinburne
along the sea . Ah yet would God that stems and roots were bred Out of my,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"weary body and my head , That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal , And",Algernon Charles Swinburne
I were as the least of all his dead . Would God my blood were dew to,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"feed the grass , Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass , My body",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"broken as a turning wheel , And my mouth stricken ere it saith Alas ! Ah God",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", that love were as a flower or flame , That life were as the naming of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"a name , That death were not more pitiful than desire , That these things were not",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"one thing and the same ! Behold now , surely somewhere there is death : For each",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"man hath some space of years , he saith , A little space of time ere time",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"expire , A little day , a little way of breath . And lo , between the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sundawn and the sun , His day 's work and his night 's work are undone ;",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"And lo , between the nightfall and the light , He is not , and none knoweth",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"of such an one . Ah God , that I were as all souls that be ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"As any herb or leaf of any tree , As men that toil through hours of labouring",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"night , As bones of men under the deep sharp sea . Outside it must be winter",Algernon Charles Swinburne
among men ; For at the gold bars of the gates again I heard all night and,Algernon Charles Swinburne
all the hours of it The wind 's wet wings and fingers drip with rain . Knights,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"gather , riding sharp for cold ; I know The ways and woods are strangled with the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"snow ; And with short song the maidens spin and sit Until Christ 's birthnight , lily-like",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", arow . The scent and shadow shed about me make The very soul in all my",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"senses ache ; The hot hard night is fed upon my breath , And sleep beholds me",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"from afar awake . Alas , but surely where the hills grow deep , Or where the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"wild ways of the sea are steep , Or in strange places somewhere there is death ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
And on death 's face the scattered hair of sleep . There lover-like with lips and limbs,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"that meet They lie , they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat ; But me the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"hot and hungry days devour , And in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet .",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"No fruit of theirs , but fruit of my desire , For her love 's sake whose",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"lips through mine respire ; Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower , Mine eyelids",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"on mine eyes like fire on fire . So lie we , not as sleep that lies",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"by death , With heavy kisses and with happy breath ; Not as man lies by woman",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", when the bride Laughs low for love 's sake and the words he saith . For",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"she lies , laughing low with love ; she lies And turns his kisses on her lips",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"to sighs , To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied , And the sweet tears are tender with",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"her eyes . Ah , not as they , but as the souls that were Slain in",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"the old time , having found her fair ; Who , sleeping with her lips upon their",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"eyes , Heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair . Their blood runs round the roots of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
time like rain : She casts them forth and gathers them again ; With nerve and bone,Algernon Charles Swinburne
she weaves and multiplies Exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain . Her little chambers drip with flower-like,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"red , Her girdles , and the chaplets of her head , Her armlets and her anklets",Algernon Charles Swinburne
; with her feet She tramples all that winepress of the dead . Her gateways smoke with,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"fume of flowers and fires , With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires ; Between her lips",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"the steam of them is sweet , The languor in her ears of many lyres . Her",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"beds are full of perfume and sad sound , Her doors are made with music , and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"barred round With sighing and with laughter and with tears , With tears whereby strong souls of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
men are bound . There is the knight Adonis that was slain ; With flesh and blood,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"she chains him for a chain ; The body and the spirit in her ears Cry ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"for her lips divide him vein by vein . Yea , all she slayeth ; yea ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"every man save me ; Me , love , thy lover that must cleave to thee Till",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"the ending of the days and ways of earth , The shaking of the sources of the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sea . Me , most forsaken of all souls that fell ; Me , satiated with things",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"insatiable ; Me , for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth , Yea , laughter kindles",Algernon Charles Swinburne
at the heart of hell . Alas thy beauty ! for thy mouth 's sweet sake My,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"soul is bitter to me , my limbs quake As water , as the flesh of men",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"that weep , As their heart 's vein whose heart goes nigh to break . Ah God",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips ; Ah",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"God , that death would tread the grapes of sleep And wring their juice upon me as",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"it drips . There is no change of cheer for many days , But change of chimes",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"high up in the air , that sways Rung by the running fingers of the wind ;",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways . Day smiteth day in twain , night sundereth night",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light ; Yea , Lord , thou",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"knowest I know not , having sinned , If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight",Algernon Charles Swinburne
". Yea , as if earth were sprinkled over me , Such chafed harsh earth as chokes",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"a sandy sea , Each pore doth yearn , and the dried blood thereof Gasps by sick",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"fits , my heart swims heavily , There is a feverish famine in my veins ; Below",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"her bosom , where a crushed grape stains The white and blue , there my lips caught",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"and clove An hour since , and what mark of me remains ? I dare not always",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"touch her , lest the kiss Leave my lips charred . Yea , Lord , a little",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"bliss , Brief bitter bliss , one hath for a great sin ; Nathless thou knowest how",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sweet a thing it is . Sin , is it sin whereby men 's souls are thrust",Algernon Charles Swinburne
Into the pit ? yet had I a good trust To save my soul before it slipped,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"therein , Trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust . For if mine eyes fail and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"my soul takes breath , I look between the iron sides of death Into sad hell where",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"all sweet love hath end , All but the pain that never finisheth . There are the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"naked faces of great kings , The singing folk with all their lute-playings ; There when one",Algernon Charles Swinburne
cometh he shall have to friend The grave that covets and the worm that clings . There,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sit the knights that were so great of hand , The ladies that were queens of fair",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"green land , Grown grey and black now , brought unto the dust , Soiled , without",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"raiment , clad about with sand . There is one end for all of them ; they",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sit Naked and sad , they drink the dregs of it , Trodden as grapes in the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"wine-press of lust , Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet . I see the marvellous mouth",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"whereby there fell Cities and people whom the gods loved well , Yet for her sake on",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"them the fire gat hold , And for their sakes on her the fire of hell .",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"And softer than the Egyptian lote-leaf is , The queen whose face was worth the world to",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"kiss , Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold ; And large pale lips of strong",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Semiramis , Curled like a tiger 's that curl back to feed ; Red only where the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"last kiss made them bleed ; Her hair most thick with many a carven gem , Deep",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"in the mane , great-chested , like a steed . Yea , with red sin the faces",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"of them shine ; But in all these there was no sin like mine ; No ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
not in all the strange great sins of them That made the wine-press froth and foam with,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"wine . For I was of Christ 's choosing , I God 's knight , No blinkard",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"heathen stumbling for scant light ; I can well see , for all the dusty days Gone",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"past , the clean great time of goodly fight . I smell the breathing battle sharp with",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"blows , With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows ; The fair pure sword smites",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"out in subtle ways , Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows Of beautiful mailed",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"men ; the edged light slips , Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Sharp from the beautifully bending head , With all its gracious body lithe as lips That curl",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"in touching you ; right in this wise My sword doth , seeming fire in mine own",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"eyes , Leaving all colours in them brown and red And flecked with death ; then the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"keen breaths like sighs , The caught-up choked dry laughters following them , When all the fighting",Algernon Charles Swinburne

the heart 's gladness of the goodly game . Let me think yet a little ; I,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"do know These things were sweet , but sweet such years ago , Their savour is all",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"turned now into tears ; Yea , ten years since , where the blue ripples blow ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"The blue curled eddies of the blowing Rhine , I felt the sharp wind shaking grass and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"vine Touch my blood too , and sting me with delight Through all this waste and weary",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"body of mine That never feels clear air ; right gladly then I rode alone , a",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"great way off my men , And heard the chiming bridle smite and smite , And gave",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"each rhyme thereof some rhyme again , Till my song shifted to that iron one ; Seeing",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"there rode up between me and the sun Some certain of my foe 's men , for",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"his three White wolves across their painted coats did run . The first red-bearded , with square",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"cheeks — alack , I made my knave 's blood turn his beard to black ; The",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"slaying of him was a joy to see : Perchance too , when at night he came",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"not back , Some woman fell a-weeping , whom this thief Would beat when he had drunken",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"; yet small grief Hath any for the ridding of such knaves ; Yea , if one",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"wept , I doubt her teen was brief . This bitter love is sorrow in all lands",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", Draining of eyelids , wringing of drenched hands , Sighing of hearts and filling up of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"graves ; A sign across the head of the world he stands , An one that hath",Algernon Charles Swinburne
a plague-mark on his brows ; Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house Down,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"under earth ; sweet smells of lip and cheek , Like a sweet snake 's breath made",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"more poisonous With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass , Are shed all round his passage if",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"he pass , And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak , Sick with keen guessing",Algernon Charles Swinburne
whence the perfume was . As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds Smells the rare,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"scent made where a panther feeds , And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell Is snapped upon",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"by the sweet mouth and bleeds , His head far down the hot sweet throat of her",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"— So one tracks love , whose breath is deadlier , And lo , one springe and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"you are fast in hell , Fast as the gin 's grip of a wayfarer . I",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"think now , as the heavy hours decease One after one , and bitter thoughts increase One",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"upon one , of all sweet finished things ; The breaking of the battle ; the long",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"peace Wherein we sat clothed softly , each man 's hair Crowned with green leaves beneath white",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"hoods of vair ; The sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings , And noise of singing",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"in the late sweet air . I sang of love too , knowing nought thereof ; ''",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Sweeter , '' I said , `` the little laugh of love Than tears out of the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"eyes of Magdalen , Or any fallen feather of the Dove . `` The broken little laugh",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"that spoils a kiss , The ache of purple pulses , and the bliss Of blinded eyelids",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"that expand again — Love draws them open with those lips of his , '' Lips that",Algernon Charles Swinburne

"; Then ere one sleep , appeased with sacrifice , Where his lips wounded , there his",Algernon Charles Swinburne

", here is love , or there is love , God wot , This man and that",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"finds favour in his eyes , '' I said , `` but I , what guerdon have",Algernon Charles Swinburne
I got ? `` The dust of praise that is blown everywhere In all men 's faces,Algernon Charles Swinburne
with the common air ; The bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet Before they wind it,Algernon Charles Swinburne
in a singer 's hair . '' So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing ; I,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"had no hope but of some evil thing , And so rode slowly past the windy wheat",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"And past the vineyard and the water-spring , Up to the Horsel . A great elder-tree Held",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"back its heaps of flowers to let me see The ripe tall grass , and one that",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"walked therein , Naked , with hair shed over to the knee . She walked between the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"blossom and the grass ; I knew the beauty of her , what she was , The",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"beauty of her body and her sin , And in my flesh the sin of hers ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
alas ! Alas ! for sorrow is all the end of this . O sad kissed mouth,Algernon Charles Swinburne
", how sorrowful it is ! O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings , Red with the",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"bitter blossom of a kiss ! Ah , with blind lips I felt for you , and",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"found About my neck your hands and hair enwound , The hands that stifle and the hair",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"that stings , I felt them fasten sharply without sound . Yea , for my sin I",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"had great store of bliss : Rise up , make answer for me , let thy kiss",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin , Lest one go mad to hear how",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"sweet it is . Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers , And murmuring of",Algernon Charles Swinburne
the heavy-headed hours ; And let the dove 's beak fret and peck within My lips in,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"vain , and Love shed fruitless flowers . So that God looked upon me when your hands",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Were hot about me ; yea , God brake my bands To save my soul alive ,",Algernon Charles Swinburne
and I came forth Like a man blind and naked in strange lands That hears men laugh,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"and weep , and knows not whence Nor wherefore , but is broken in his sense ;",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"Howbeit I met folk riding from the north Towards Rome , to purge them of their souls",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"' offence , And rode with them , and spake to none ; the day Stunned me",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"like lights upon some wizard way , And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight ;",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"So rode I , hearing all these chant and pray , And marvelled ; till before us",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"rose and fell White cursed hills , like outer skirts of hell Seen where men 's eyes",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"look through the day to night , Like a jagged shell 's lips , harsh , untunable",Algernon Charles Swinburne
", Blown in between by devils ' wrangling breath ; Nathless we won well past that hell",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"and death , Down to the sweet land where all airs are good , Even unto Rome",Algernon Charles Swinburne
where God 's grace tarrieth . Then came each man and worshipped at his knees Who in,Algernon Charles Swinburne
"the Lord God 's likeness bears the keys To bind or loose , and called on Christ",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"'s shed blood , And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease . But when I came",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"I fell down at his feet , Saying , `` Father , though the Lord 's blood",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"be right sweet , The spot it takes not off the panther 's skin , Nor shall",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"an Ethiop 's stain be bleached with it . `` Lo , I have sinned and have",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"spat out at God , Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod More sharp because of",Algernon Charles Swinburne

"yea , for my sake I wot The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot Through",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"my great sin . '' Then spake he some sweet word , Giving me cheer ; which",Algernon Charles Swinburne
"thing availed me not ; Yea , scarce I wist if such indeed were said ; For",Algernon Charles Swinburne
